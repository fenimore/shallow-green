    <h2>The Site</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>This site is run with <i>Go</i>, no framework. (Unfortunately there isn't a Chess programming language).</li>
	<li>The Human versus Human client doesn't work on Heroku. It is a websockets powered client and is currently supporting only one game at a time.</li>
	<li>The database is a key-value store BoltDB, which is a lightweight Go database.</li>
	<li>The AI games are implemented with AJAX, so if the move timesout, one must refresh the page.</li>
	<li>The underlying chess engine is likewise written by Fenimore, it's likewise in Go, and it's likewise got some bugs left in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Minimax</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>Implements alpha beta pruning.</li>
	    <li>A fair bit slower on heroku.</li>
	    <li>Looks three ply depth.</li>
	</ul>
